# Camera Configuration Status

## ‚úÖ Currently Active Cameras (3/4)

Your multiview detection system is currently configured with **3 working cameras**:

### Camera 0: MacBook Pro Camera
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080
- **FPS**: 30
- **Type**: Built-in camera

### Camera 1: HERO11 Black  
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080
- **FPS**: 30
- **Type**: USB camera

### Camera 2: Insta360 X3
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080
- **FPS**: 30
- **Type**: USB camera

### Camera 3: OBS Virtual Camera
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Detected but not working
- **Issue**: Camera opens but no frames are received
- **Solution**: See instructions below

## üîß To Enable OBS Virtual Camera (4th Camera)

The OBS Virtual Camera is detected by the system but not providing video frames. To fix this:

### Step 1: Start OBS Studio
1. Open OBS Studio application
2. Set up your scene with sources (screen capture, window capture, etc.)

### Step 2: Start Virtual Camera
1. In OBS Studio, click "Start Virtual Camera" button
2. Choose "OBS Camera Extension" as the camera type
3. Set output resolution to 1920x1080
4. Click "Start"

### Step 3: Verify Camera
1. Run the camera detection script to verify:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ezrafine/Documents/Deep-Live-Cam-Backup/multiview_detection_system
   python3 detect_cameras.py
   ```

### Step 4: Update Configuration
If OBS Virtual Camera is now working:
1. Edit `config.py`
2. Change `'enabled': False` to `'enabled': True` for camera ID 3
3. Restart the detection system:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh restart
   ```

## üåê Web Interface

Your detection system is running at: **http://localhost:5001**

### Features Available:
- Live feeds from all 3 cameras
- Real-time object detection with YOLOv8
- Detection statistics and analytics
- Start/Stop controls for the detection system

## üìä System Performance

Current performance with 3 cameras:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 per camera
- **Detection Model**: YOLOv8 Nano (fast)
- **Expected FPS**: ~7-8 FPS per camera
- **Total Processing**: ~21-24 FPS across all cameras

## üõ† Camera Management Commands

```bash
# Check camera status
python3 detect_cameras.py

# Start detection system
./start.sh start

# Stop detection system
./start.sh stop

# Restart detection system
./start.sh restart

# View logs
./start.sh logs

# Run in development mode
./start.sh dev
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If a camera stops working:
1. Check if camera is still connected
2. Run `python3 detect_cameras.py` to re-detect
3. Restart the detection system

### Performance issues:
- Reduce resolution in `config.py`
- Use lighter YOLO model (already using nano)
- Ensure sufficient system resources

### OBS Virtual Camera issues:
- Make sure OBS Studio is running
- Verify Virtual Camera is started in OBS
- Check camera permissions in System Preferences
- Try restarting OBS Studio

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Test the current 3-camera setup** at http://localhost:5001
2. **Enable OBS Virtual Camera** if needed for 4-camera setup
3. **Customize detection settings** in `config.py`
4. **Monitor performance** and adjust settings as needed

Your multiview detection system is ready to use with 3 cameras! üéâ
